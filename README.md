# QA Practical Project - Prize Generator



DISCLAIMER: This application has been purely built for educational purposes as part of QA training, and is not to be officially deployed.

## Planning:

For planning purposes, I created a Kanban Board on Trello. You can find it [here.](https://trello.com/b/9rVOaiOL/dd-character-generator)

Here is the initial version of the Kanban Board, before it is fully populated:

## Cloud Server:

When it comes to the Cloud, I utilised GCP. Here, you can see the four VMs I have created on Ubuntu 20.10:

I also used a MySQL Database to store the generated strings and numbers from services 2 and 3, and the prizes generated from service 4.

## Credits:

The application idea was mine, spurred by the QA DevOps Practical Project specification.
Whilst the code is entirely my own, I owe a lot to the QA Community website, my trainer Dara Oladapo, and other QA Trainees.
